Since our introductory MSc course has been withdrawn, I am regularly asked by MSc / PhD students what options exist to get some training on Bayesian analysis.

# Some courses on the subject that I don't know much about, but became aware of and compiled lately

https://smstc.ac.uk/core_modules/modern_regression_bayesian_methods (quite mathematical, from the feedback I got)

This one runs almost every year (I think, in different places each time):
http://bayessummerschool.com/index.html (good, a bit dense for beginners from what I’ve heard)

https://www.coursera.org/learn/bayesian 
http://outreach.mathstat.strath.ac.uk/outreach/cpd/courses/index.php (if it runs again next year?)

CEH course:
https://www.ceh.ac.uk/training/bayesian-methods-ecological-and-environmental-modelling (looking dense from the program).

There is a good one for population ecologists (by Kery and Schaub) which I believe will run in Argentina next - check their website or phidot.org.

This last one is very soon, so better hurry up if interested:

Even though it says “intermediate”, it looks like the exact right level for a newcomer to Bayesian stats, based on the listed contents. 
Sounds like they mean more like “intermediate stats level” rather than “intermediate Bayesian statistics”, so I expect it should suit students who regularly work with R and understand the basics of GLMs or MEM, for example. Contact them if unsure!

If you want to learn by yourself, these books could be very good starting points:
“Doing Bayesian Data Analysis: A Tutorial with R, JAGS, and Stan” (by Kruschke: More general and up-to-date - includes Stan)
“Introduction to WinBUGS for Ecologists” (by Kery and Schaub: book is a bit old but still very relevant for ecologists)

If you think of other/better ones, let me know. I'll try to update the list as I hear about new resources.
If you attend any of the courses above (or other ones), I’d appreciate any feedback!

A good place to contact me is @TCornulier on twitter or by email - shouldn't be hard to find!
